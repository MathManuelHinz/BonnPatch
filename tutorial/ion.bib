We introduce a new convergent learning algorithm for HMMs that, unlike the classical Baum-Welch algorithm is smooth and can be applied on-line or in batch mode, with or without the usual Viterbi most likely path approximation. Left-right HMMs with insertion and deletion states are then trained to represent several protein families including immunoglobulins and kinases. In all cases, the models derived capture all the important statistical properties of the families and can be used efficiently in a number of important tasks such as multiple alignment, motif detection, and classification.},

Computer simulated data for three different models of agonist receptor gated channels are used to demonstrate the performance of the procedure. Full details of the implementation of the algorithm are given for an example gating mechanism. The effects of omission of brief openings and closings from the single-channel data on parameter estimation are explored. A strategy for discriminating between alternative possible gating models, based upon use of the Schwarz criterion, is described. Omission of brief events is shown not to lead to incorrect model identification, except in extreme circumstances. Finally, the algorithm is extended to include channel gating models exhibiting multiple conductance levels.},

  abstract = {Markov jump processes are continuous-time stochastic processes which describe dynamical systems evolving in discrete state spaces. These processes find wide application in the natural sciences and machine learning, but their inference is known to be far from trivial. In this work we introduce a methodology for zeroshot inference of Markov jump processes (MJPs), on bounded state spaces, from noisy and sparse observations, which consists of two components. First, a broad probability distribution over families of MJPs, as well as over possible observation times and noise mechanisms, with which we simulate a synthetic dataset of hidden MJPs and their noisy observation process. Second, a neural network model that processes subsets of the simulated observations, and that is trained to output the initial condition and rate matrix of the target MJP in a supervised way. We empirically demonstrate that one and the same (pretrained) model can infer, in a zero-shot fashion, hidden MJPs evolving in state spaces of different dimensionalities. Specifically, we infer MJPs which describe (i) discrete flashing ratchet systems, which are a type of Brownian motors, and the conformational dynamics in (ii) molecular simulations, (iii) experimental ion channel data and (iv) simple protein folding models. What is more, we show that our model performs on par with state-of-the-art models which are finetuned to the target datasets.},

  abstract = {Techniques for extracting small, single channel ion currents from background noise are described and tested. It is assumed that single channel currents are generated by a first-order, finite-state, discrete-time, Markov process to which is added 'whiteâ background noise from the recording apparatus (electrode, amplifiers, etc.). Given the observations and the statistics of the background noise, the techniques described here yield               a posteriori               estimates of the most likely signal statistics, including the Markov model state transition probabilities, duration (open- and closed-time) probabilities, histograms, signal levels, and the most likely state sequence. Using variations of several algorithms previously developed for solving digital estimation problems, we have demonstrated that: (1) artificial, small, first-order, finite-state, Markov model signals embedded in simulated noise can be extracted with a high degree of accuracy, (2) processing can detect signals that do not conform to a first-order Markov model but the method is less accurate when the background noise is not white, and (3) the techniques can be used to extract from the baseline noise single channel currents in neuronal membranes. Some studies have been included to test the validity of assuming a first-order Markov model for biological signals. This method can be used to obtain directly from digitized data, channel characteristics such as amplitude distributions, transition matrices and open- and closed-time durations.},

In this paper these methods are generalized so that the observable characteristics of bursts can be calculated directly for any mechanism that has transition probabilities that are independent of time as long as the process is at equilibrium or is maintained in a steady state by an energy supply. General expressions are given for the distributions of the open time, the number of openings per burst, the total open time per burst, the gaps within and between bursts, and so on. With the aid of these general results a single computer program can be written that will provide numerical values for such distributions for postulated mechanism, given only the transition rates between the various states. The results are illustrated by a numerical example of a mechanism in which two agonist molecules can bind sequentially, and either singly or doubly occupied receptor ion channels may open. The analogous theory is also given for the case where bursts of channel openings are grouped into clusters; many of the results bear a close analogy with those found for simple bursts.},

As a next step we aim to find the generator of a continuous-time Markov chain whose eigenspectrum resembles the observed eigenspectrum as closely as possible, using an appropriate norm. The generator is found by solving a minimization problem: the norm is chosen such that the object function is quadratic and convex, so that the minimization problem can be solved using quadratic programming techniques.

It follows that reducible schemes with the same waiting time PDFs are not distinguishable; namely, such schemes lead to identical two-state trajectories in the statistical sense. In this work, we further characterize the topologies of kinetic schemes, now of irreducible schemes, and further study two-state trajectories from the two types of scheme. We suggest various methods for extracting information about the underlying kinetic scheme from the trajectory (e.g., calculate the binned successive waiting times PDFs and analyze the ordered waiting time trajectories), and point out the advantages and disadvantages of each. We show that the binned successive waiting times PDFs are not only more robust than other functions when analyzing finite trajectories, but contain, in most cases, more information about the underlying kinetic scheme than other functions in the limit of infinitely long trajectories. For some cases, however, analyzing the ordered waiting times trajectory may supply unique information about the underlying kinetic scheme.},

It follows that reducible schemes with the same waiting time PDFs are not distinguishable; namely, such schemes lead to identical two-state trajectories in the statistical sense. In this work, we further characterize the topologies of kinetic schemes, now of irreducible schemes, and further study two-state trajectories from the two types of scheme. We suggest various methods for extracting information about the underlying kinetic scheme from the trajectory (e.g., calculate the binned successive waiting times PDFs and analyze the ordered waiting time trajectories), and point out the advantages and disadvantages of each. We show that the binned successive waiting times PDFs are not only more robust than other functions when analyzing finite trajectories, but contain, in most cases, more information about the underlying kinetic scheme than other functions in the limit of infinitely long trajectories. For some cases, however, analyzing the ordered waiting times trajectory may supply unique information about the underlying kinetic scheme.},

A key to their effectiveness from a computational point of view is that the number of operations to evaluate the likelihood, posterior probabilities and the most likely state sequence is proportional to the product of the square of the dimension of the state space and the length of the series. However, when the state space is quite large, computations can become infeasible. This can happen when the record has been lowpass filtered and when the noise is colored. In this paper, we present an approximate method that can provide very substantial reductions in computational cost at the expense of only a very small error. We describe the method and illustrate through examples the gains that can be made in evaluating the likelihood.},

We used certain correlation functions to extract information about the pathways connecting the open and closed states of the cation channel of the purified nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and of the chloride channel of Torpedo californica electroplax membranes. Single channel currents were recorded from planar lipid bilayers containing the membrane channel proteins under investigation. The correlation functions are conveniently computed from single channel current records and yield information on E, the minimum number of entry/exit states into the open or closed aggregates. E gives a lower limit on the numbers of transition pathways between open and closed states. For the acetylcholine receptor, the autocorrelation analysis shows that there are at least two entry/exit states through which the open and closed aggregates communicate. The chloride channel fluctuates between three conductance substates, here indentified as C, M, and H for closed, intermediate, and high conductance, respectively. Correlation analysis shows that E is \_2 for the M aggregate, indicating that there are at least two distinct entry/exit states in the M aggregate. In contrast, there is no evidence for the existence of more than one entry/exit state in the C or H aggregates. Thus, these correlation functions provide a simple and general strategy to extract information on channel gating kinetics.},

We then compare these error bounds with relevant concepts in the literature such as exact and ordinary lumpability as well as deflatability and aggregatability. These concepts define stricter than necessary conditions to identify settings in which the aggregation error is zero. We also consider possible algorithms for finding suitable aggregations for which the formal error bounds are low, and we analyse first experiments with these algorithms on different models.},

Current solutions rely on iterative routines like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and Variational Inference (VI), which need to be re-run whenever new observations are available. Amortization, through conditional estimation, is a viable strategy to alleviate such difficulties and has been the guiding principle behind simulation-based inference, neural processes and in-context methods using pre-trained models. In this work, we conduct a thorough comparative analysis of amortized in-context Bayesian posterior estimation methods from the lens of different optimization objectives and architectural choices. Such methods train an amortized estimator to perform posterior parameter inference by conditioning on a set of data examples passed as context to a sequence model such as a transformer. In contrast to language models, we leverage permutation invariant architectures as the true posterior is invariant to the ordering of context examples. Our empirical study includes generalization to outof-distribution tasks, cases where the assumed underlying model is misspecified, and transfer from simulated to real problems. Subsequently, it highlights the superiority of the reverse KL estimator for predictive problems, especially when combined with the transformer architecture and normalizing flows.},

Whether the associated algorithms are used to compute an actual probability or, more generally, an odds ratio or some other score, a frequent requirement is that the error statistics of a given score be known. What is the chance that random data would achieve that score or better? What is the chance that a real signal would achieve a given score threshold? Results: Here we present a novel general approach to estimating these false positive and true positive rates that is significantly more efficient than are existing general approaches. We validate the technique via an implementation within the HMMER 3.0 package, which scans DNA or protein sequence databases for patterns of interest, using a profile-HMM. Conclusion: The new approach is faster than general naÃ¯ve sampling approaches, and more general than other current approaches. It provides an efficient mechanism by which to estimate error statistics for hidden Markov model and hidden Boltzmann model results.},

  abstract = {Single-channel patch-clamp recordings allow observing the action of a single protein complex in real time and hence the deduction of the underlying conformational changes in the ion-channel protein. Commonly, recordings are modeled using hidden Markov chains, connecting open and closed states in the experimental data with protein conformations. The rates between states denote transition probabilities that could be modified by membrane voltage or ligand binding. Modeling algorithms have to deal with limited recording bandwidth and a very noisy background. It was previously shown that the fit of twodimensional (2D)-dwell-time histograms with simulations is very robust in that regard. Errors introduced by the low-pass filter or noise cancel out to a certain degree when comparing experimental and simulated data. In addition, the topology of models (that is, the chain of open and closed states) could be inferred from 2D-histograms. However, the 2D-fit was never applied to its full potential. A major reason may be the extremely time-consuming and often unreliable fitting process, due to the stochastic variability in the simulations. We have now solved these issues by introducing a message-passing interface (MPI) allowing massive parallel computing on a high-performance computing (HPC) cluster and obtaining ensemble solutions. With ensembles, we have demonstrated how important ranked solutions are for difficult tasks related to a noisy background, fast gating events beyond the corner frequency of the low-pass filter, and topology estimation of the underlying Markov model. Finally, we have shown that, by combining the objective function of the 2D-fit with the deviation of the current amplitude distributions, automatic determination of the current level of the conducting state is possible, even with an apparent current reduction due to low-pass filtering. Making use of an HPC cluster, the power of 2D-dwell-time analysis can be used to its fullest with minor input of the experimenter.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The patch-clamp technique allows us to eavesdrop the gating behavior of individual ion channels with unprecedented temporal resolution. The signals arise from conformational changes of the channel protein as it makes rapid transitions between conducting and non-conducting states. However, unambiguous analysis of single-channel datasets is challenging given the inadvertently low signal-to-noise ratio as well as signal distortions caused by low-pass filtering. Ion channel kinetics are typically described using hidden Markov models (HMM), which allow conclusions on the inner workings of the protein. In this study, we present a Deep Learning approach for extracting models from single-channel recordings. Two-dimensional dwell-time histograms are computed from the idealized time series and are subsequently analyzed by two neural networks, that have been trained on simulated datasets, to determine the topology and the transition rates of the HMM. We show that this method is robust regarding noise and gating events beyond the corner frequency of the low-pass filter. In addition, we propose a method to evaluate the goodness of a predicted model by re-simulating the prediction. Finally, we tested the algorithm with data recorded on a patch-clamp setup. In principle, it meets the requirements for model extraction during an ongoing recording session in real-time.},

  abstract = {Single-channel recordings provide unprecedented resolutions on kinetics of conformational changes of ion channels. Several approaches exist for analysis of the data, including the dwell-time histogram fittings and the full maximallikelihood approaches that fit either the idealized dwell-time sequence or more ambitiously the noisy data directly using hidden Markov modeling. Although the full maximum likelihood approaches are statistically advantageous, they can be time-consuming especially for large datasets and/or complex models. We present here an alternative approach for model-based fitting of onedimensional and two-dimensional dwell-time histograms. To improve performance, we derived analytical expressions for the derivatives of one-dimensional and two-dimensional dwell-time distribution functions and employed the gradient-based variable metric method for fast search of optimal rate constants in a model. The algorithm also has the ability to allow for a first-order correction for the effects of missed events, global fitting across different experimental conditions, and imposition of typical constraints on rate constants including microscopic reversibility. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the performance of the algorithm, and comparisons with the full maximum likelihood fitting are discussed.},

  abstract = {Although initially introduced and studied in the late 1960s and early 1970s, statistical methods of Markov source or hidden Markov modeling have become increasingly popular in the last several years. There are two strong reasons why this has occurred. First the models are very rich in mathematical structure and hence can form the theoretical basis for use in a wide range of applications. Second the models, when applied properly, work very well in practice for several important applications. In this paper we attempt to carefully and methodically review the theoretical aspects of this type of statistical modeling and show how they have been applied to selected problems in machine recognition of speech.},

It is based on a multi-model approach with detection of jumps from one model to another. It is well suited for adaptive control purposes: Switching to an alternative model is only p erformed if this new one predicts the system output significantly better than the present model. This implies an intrinsic robustness against minor excitation. The identified model remains constant between the discrete jump moments. This separates the identification algorithm from the short-time system dynamics, and the controller design can be based on constant parameters. Another benefit for the design procedure is the possibility to specify the desired accuracy by defining the distance between neighboring models in the parameter space.},

  abstract = {Ion channels are characterized by inherently stochastic behavior which can be represented by continuous-time Markov models (CTMM). Although methods for collecting data from single ion channels are available, translating a time series of open and closed channels to a CTMM remains a challenge. Bayesian statistics combined with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling provide means for estimating the rate constants of a CTMM directly from single channel data. In this article, different approaches for the MCMC sampling of Markov models are combined. This method, new to our knowledge, detects overparameterizations and gives more accurate results than existing MCMC methods. It shows similar performance as QuBMIL, which indicates that it also compares well with maximum likelihood estimators. Data collected from an inositol trisphosphate receptor is used to demonstrate how the best model for a given data set can be found in practice.},

  abstract = {The selectivity filter of K+ channels catalyzes a rapid and highly selective transport of K+ while serving as a gate. To understand the control of this filter gate, we use the pore-only K+ channel KcvNTS in which gating is exclusively determined by the activity of the filter gate. It has been previously shown that a mutation at the C-terminus of the pore-helix (S42T) increases K+ permeability and introduces distinct voltage-dependent and K+-sensitive channel closures at depolarizing voltages. Here, we report that the latter are not generated by intrinsic conformational changes of the filter gate but by a voltage-dependent block caused by nanomolar trace contaminations of Ba2+ in the KCl solution. Channel closures can be alleviated by extreme positive voltages and they can be completely abolished by the high-affinity Ba2+ chelator 18C6TA. By contrast, the same channel closures can be augmented by adding Ba2+ at submicromolar concentrations to the cytosolic buffer. These data suggest that a conservative exchange of Ser for Thr in a crucial position of the filter gate increases the affinity of the filter for Ba2+ by \&gt;200-fold at positive voltages. While Ba2+ ions apparently remain only for a short time in the filter-binding sites of the WT channel before passing the pore, they remain much longer in the mutant channel. Our findings suggest that the dwell times of permeating and blocking ions in the filter-binding sites are tightly controlled by interactions between the pore-helix and the selectivity filter.},

  abstract = {Markov jump processes are continuous-time stochastic processes widely used in statistical applications in the natural sciences, and more recently in machine learning. Inference for these models typically proceeds via Markov chain Monte Carlo, and can suffer from various computational challenges. In this work, we propose a novel collapsed variational inference algorithm to address this issue. Our work leverages ideas from discrete-time Markov chains, and exploits a connection between these two through an idea called uniformization. Our algorithm proceeds by marginalizing out the parameters of the Markov jump process, and then approximating the distribution over the trajectory with a factored distribution over segments of a piecewise-constant function. Unlike MCMC schemes that marginalize out transition times of a piecewise-constant process, our scheme optimizes the discretization of time, resulting in significant computational savings. We apply our ideas to synthetic data as well as a dataset of check-in recordings, where we demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art MCMC methods.},
